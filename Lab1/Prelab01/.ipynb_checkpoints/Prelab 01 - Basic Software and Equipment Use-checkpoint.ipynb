    "Generating waveforms from samples starts with a Python script that sends a sequence of samples to the ADALM2000 via a USB cable. The ADALM2000 generates waveforms on its output ports at a fixed rate $f_{\\text{DAC}}$. To reduce processing complexity, the effective sampling rate of the samples sent to the ADALM2000 is typically much lower than $f_{\\text{DAC}}$. That is why we need an interpolation stage: to upsample the signal to reach $f_{\\text{DAC}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better grasp the advantage of interpolation, let's assume that the signal of interest is a 1 kHz sinusoid. It could be generated and then sent to the ADALM with a sampling rate of $f_{\\text{DAC}}$, but that would be wasteful since $f_{\\text{DAC}}$ is typically on the order of mega (one million) samples per second. Instead, we produce the waveform at a reasonable frequency (e.g., 3000 samples per second) and then the ADALM interpolates it to make it suitable for transmission at $f_{\\text{DAC}}$. \n",
