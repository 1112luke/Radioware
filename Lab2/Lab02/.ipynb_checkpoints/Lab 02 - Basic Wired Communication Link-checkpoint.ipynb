        "\n",
        "The purpose of this lab is to establish wireline communication between a transmitter and receiver and to explore relationships among parameter settings and system performance. We introduce some additional software tools and the use of command line interface, as it complements the Jupyter Notebook interface.\n",

        "### Key System Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "On-Off signaling, which is also called On-Off Keying (OOK), transmits digital data using the presence and absence of a signal in each signaling interval of duration $T > 0$ seconds, and hence the bit rate is $R_b = 1/T$ bits per second (bps). Specifically, the presence of a signal for a period of $T$ seconds represents a binary \"1\", or the absence of the signal for $T$ seconds represents a binary \"0\". The communication system examined in today's lab utilizes is a *baseband* system, and for such a system there are some key parameters need to be considered during the design process. They are, Digital-Analog Converter (DAC) effective sampling frequency $f_s$, the oversampling factor $M$ representing the number of samples per binary input to the DAC, and the packet size $N$. Each of these parameters is described in more detail below:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **DAC Effective Sampling Rate** $f_s$: The DAC is a crucial component of the communication system in the transmitter because it converts the discrete-time signal we generate in software (e.g., samples of a signaling waveform, etc.) into an analog signal that can be transmitted through a wired or wireless link. The most important parameter of a DAC is its effective sampling rate $f_s$, the number of input samples converted per second.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Oversampling Factor** $M$: Since we will be processing samples of the signal at the transmitter and the receiver, a natural question to ask is how many samples to generate during the signaling interval $T$ seconds. We define an integer $M = f_s/R$ to be the *oversampling* factor, the bit rate then becomes $R_b = f_s/M$ bps. For a given $f_s$, a larger oversampling factor will allow us to generate a more accurate waveform in continuous time, but it reduces the data rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Packet Length** $N$: Our system will form packets of lengths $N$ bits, which we call the *packet length*. The packet length of a communication system will have influence on both it's throughput as well as it's packet error ratio (PER). Although various kinds of packet structures are adopted in modern communication networks for different purposes, two basic fields that are often present in a packet are a *header* and a *payload*.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * The *header* signals the receiver the arrival of data and also provides other information such as the destination address, the sender's address, the length of the packet for packets of variable size as well as the protocals used.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * The *payload* section contains the actual data that is to be received by the receiver. "

It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, buffers and protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP with IPv4 and IPv6). For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters. iPerf has client and server functionality, and can create data streams to measure the throughput between the two ends in one or both directions. Typical iPerf output contains a time-stamped report of the amount of data transferred and the throughput measured.\n",

Wireshark will help you capture network packets and display them at a granular level. Once these packets are broken down, you can use them for real-time or offline analysis. This tool lets you put your network traffic under a microscope, and then filter and drill down into it, zooming in on the root cause of problems, assisting with network analysis and ultimately network security.\n",

The reason we are getting 37.4 kbits/s is because our transmitter (iPerf client) is set to send UDP datagrams at a default rate of 40 kbits/s. To change the transmission rate, use the optional argument \"-b\" while running the transmitter program (for help regarding optional arguments, use \"-h\"), and set the desired value.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the sender's (iPerf client's) bandwidth is too high, you may notice the datagram loss displalyed at the iPerf output page (on the server/receiver side) no longer stays at zero percent. And this tells us that if we keep increasing the bandwidth, we will reach a limit on the data rate for assuring reliable communication. Thus, to make our defintion of *throughput* more precise and specific, it is the *maximum bandwidth* you could observe from iPerf receiver's (server's) test reported along with *0 % datagram loss*."

Your task in this part of the lab is to adjust those parameters to different values in order to maximize the throughput of the OOK system.

It corresponds to the number of distinct symbol changes per unit time, across the transmission medium (wired or wireless). In our case of baseband OOK, the symbol rate is also the bit rate defined as the number of *bits* per unit time: bit \"1\" (signal waveform on) and bit \"0\" (signal waveform off) transmitted through the digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Since the DAC converts $f_s$ input samples per sec and we used $M$ (oversampling factor) samples to represent one bit, the bit rate is simply given by:\n",
